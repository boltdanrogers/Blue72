72 hour project


create webapi by creating a asp.net web aplication (.NET framework)
name the project Blue72.WebAPI, and the solution Blue72
select Web API when creating the web application, and change the authentication to individual user account, and click create
visual studio will scaffold out the solution. right click on the solution once it is done
go to add -> new project
select or search for class library (.NET framework)
name this assembly Blue72.Data; right click class1 and delete it
repeat these steps to create the models and services assemblies
Dealing with the identity model: moving it to a better location for our project
The web api project should have a models folder with a file called IdentityModels.cs
this is part of our user authentication from microsoft. to make it more accessible we need to move it
find it in the models folder of the web api and move it to the Blue72.Data folder
change its namespace to Blue72.Data; now there are errros to be resolved
currently the code in the webapi does not have access to the identitymodels.cs file
now we need to add entity framework to the projects. right click on the solution
select manage nuget packages for solution. click on the installed tab (we can do this because it came installed in our web api  assembly)
choose maicrosoft.aspnet.identity. entityframwork; click the project checkbox on the right side
after being sure all projects are selected click installed
now search for  owin, select the microsoft.aspnet.identity.owen and mircosoft.aspnetwebapi.owen
these two are only installed on the data project. now we will add our references. 
we need to decide what assemblies need to know about what other assemblies in our case
right click the webapi and go to add->
